                <h2><br>It’s time for the Mac to undergo a product-design renaissance<br></h2>
                <p>
                    This was the biggest creative flourishing in the Mac ever. The iMac added fashion colors, 
                    morphed into a round computer with a floating display, and then took up the 
                    computer-within-display approach that we still see today. The PowerBook became 
                    rubbery black with a shiny white Apple logo, then transformed again into a thin silver 
                    metallic model that’s not too far off from today’s MacBook Pros. The iBook was introduced 
                    as a brighly colored portable iMac, then moved to a monochrome plastic enclosure. 
                    Power Macs were introduced with plastic handles and bright colors—and then the colors were 
                    slowly muted away until the plastic was replaced with a perforated aluminum shell.
